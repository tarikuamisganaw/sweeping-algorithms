//! Functionality for applying various morphisms to [PathMap] and [Zipper](crate::zipper::Zipper)s
//!
//! Morphisms are a generalization of the [fold](std::iter::Iterator::fold) pattern, but for a trie or
//! sub-trie, as opposed to a list / sequence.  Similarly they rely on results being aggregated into
//! intermediate structures that are themselves joined together to produce a result.
//!
//! ### Supported Morphisms:
//!
//! #### Catamorphism
//!
//! Process a trie from the leaves towards the root.  This algorithm proceeds in a depth-first order,
//! working from the leaves upward calling a closure on each path in the trie.  A summary "accumulator"
//! type `W` is used to represent the information about the trie and carry it upwards to the next invocation
//! of the closure.
//!
//! The word "catamorphism" comes from the Greek for "down", because the root is considered the bottom
//! of the trie.  This is confusing because elsewhere we use the convention that `descend_` "deeper"
//! into the trie means moving further from the root while `ascend` moves closer to the root.  The docs
//! will stick to this convention in-spite of the Greek meaning.
//!
//! **NOTE**: The traversal order, while depth-first, is subtly different from the order of
//! [ZipperIteration::to_next_val](crate::zipper::ZipperIteration::to_next_val) and
//! [ZipperMoving::to_next_step](crate::zipper::ZipperMoving::to_next_step).  The
//! [ZipperIteration](crate::zipper::ZipperIteration) methods visit values first before descending to the
//! branches below, while the `cata` methods call the `mapper` on the deepest values first, before
//! returning to higher levels where `collapse` is called.
//!
//! #### Anamorphism
//!
//! Generate a trie from the root.  Conceptually it is the inverse of catamorphism.  This algorithm proceeds
//! from a starting point corresponding to a root of a trie, and generates branches and leaves recursively.
//!
//! ### Jumping Morphisms and the `jump` closure
//!
//! Ordinary morphism methods conceptually operate on a trie of bytes.  Therefore they execute the `alg`
//! closure for all non-leaf path positions, regardless of the existence of values.
//!
//! By contrast, `_jumping` methods conceptually operate on a trie of values.  That means the `alg` closure
//! is only called at "forking" path positions from which multiple downstream branches descend, and also for
//! the root.  There is an additional `jump` closure passed to these methods that can process an entire
//! substring from the path.
//!
//! In general, `jumping` methods will perform substantially better, so you should use them if your `alg`
//! closure simply passes the intermediate structure upwards when there is only one child branch.
//!
//! ### Side-Effecting vs Factored Iteration
//!
//! Many methods come (or will come) with a `_side_effect` and an ordinary or `factored` flavor.  The
//! algorithm is identical in both variants but the one to use depends on your situation.
//!
//! The `_side_effect` flavor of the methods will exhaustively traverse the entire trie, irrespective of
//! structural sharing within the trie.  So a subtrie that is included `n` times will be visited `n` times.
//! They take [`FnMut`] closure arguments, meaning the closures can produce side-effects, and making these
//! methods useful for things like serialization, etc.
//!
//! The ordinary `factored` flavor takes sharing into account, and thus will only visit each shared subtrie
//! once.  The methods take [`Fn`] closure arguments and they may cache and re-use intermediate results.
//! This means the intermediate result type must implement [`Clone`].
//!
//! In general, the ordinary methods should be preferred unless sife-effects are necessary, because many
//! operations produce structural sharing so the ordinary `factored` methods will likely be more efficient.
//!

        // into a regular mutable slice of `T` so it would work just like an ordinary slice.  Additionally

        // avoid the panic.
        //Additionally, if `T: Default`, the `take` method would become the ordinary mem::take, and would always
        // succeed, therefore the abstraction would have minimal cost

            //TODO Optimization Opportunity: There is likely a 2x speedup in here, that can be achieved by
            // setting all the children at the same time.  The reason is that the current behavior will create
            // a smaller node (ListNode), and then upgrade it if necessary.  But if we know in advance what
            // the node needs to hold, we could allocate the correct node right off the bat.
            //
            // I'm going to hold off on implementing this until the explicit path API is fully settled,
            // since ideally we'd call a WriteZipper method to set multiple downstream paths, but we'd want
            // some assurances those paths would actually be created, and not pruned because they're empty.
            //
            //I'm thinking this needs to take the form of a TrieNode trait method that looks something like:
            // `fn set_children_and_values(child_mask, val_mask, branches: &[??], vals: &[V])` or possibly
            // a node creation method.  Since this is designed to be used by anamorphism (trie construction)
            // perhaps we don't actually need the downstream nodes at all, and can fill them in later.
            //
            //BEWARE: This change needs to be accompanied by another change to allow an existing node's path
            // to be augmented, or the above change could be a performance step backwards.  Specifically,
            // consider a ListNode that is created with only one child, based on a mask.  Then, if the zipper
            // descends and tries to create the rest of a path, it would be a disaster if that took the form
